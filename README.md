#####Inspiration: 
The Swing dancing app is inspired from a documentary I watched a few months ago about Swing music. There seems to be a certain nostalgia about music from the 30's and dressing up to go dancing in Europe and especially in Berlin. 

#####The App: 
The approach 
1. The App is designed to list various swing dancing events in London pulling out the information from a database. 

2. The Navigation bar has five sections : Home (Swing 23), Events, Venues, Reviews and Users. When clicking on each section, the user is directed to another page that provides information on the actual section clicked on.

3. On the Events page, a list of Events with the venue picture, Event name, Event date, Venue name, time are listed. When clicking on the Event name, the user is redirected to another page with further details on the actual event including a short review written by the user.

4. The Venues page displays a list of Venues with a short description

3. Users are able to Register storing their personal information onto the database, they can add their photo onto their profile, log in/log out and edit their profile. 
4. Only registered Users can add their own reviews on Venues and rate them section

5. In the Users section, when clicking on the user's name, we are taken to the User's profile and we can view the list of reviews created by the user.

#####The build:
HTML 5, CSS, Foundation, PSQL database and Ruby on rails were used to create this App.

#####Problem and challenges:
The challenges were to link the Controller, Model and Views files to each including solving various error messages. Foundation is a great tool to style but I would need more practice to be able to have better designing results. I was unfortunately unable to create a fixed header, unable to create a logo, resize all the photos to the same width/heightand would have liked to include a google map for each venue if I had more time to complete the project.
