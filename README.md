We are designing a website that lists all Dancing Swing events in London (in a weekly listing format)


####"Swing_it

#####Inspiration: 
The Swing dancing app is inspired from a documentary I watched a few months ago about Swing music. There seems to be a certain nostalgia about music from the 30's and dressing up to go dancing in Europe and especially in Berlin. 

#####The App: 
The approach 
1. The App is designed to list various swing dancing events in London pulling out the information from a database. 
  
2. The Navigation bar has four sections : Events, Venues, Reviews and Users. When clicking on each section, the user is directed to another page that provides information on the specific section.
    
3. Pot counter decreases at beginning of every new game depending on how


#####The build:
HTML 5, CSS, Foundation, PostSQL and Ruby on rails were used to create this App.

#####Problem and challenges:
The challenges were to link the Controller, Model and Views files to each other solving various error messages. Foundation is a great tool to use but I would need more practice. I was unfortunately unable to create a fixed header and resize all the photos at the same width and height.
